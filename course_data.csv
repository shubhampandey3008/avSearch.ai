Introduction to Python,"Do you want to enter the field of Data Science? Are you intimidated by the coding you would need to learn? Are you looking to learn Python to switch to a data science career?
You have come to just the right place!
Most industry experts recommend starting your Data Science journey with Python
Across biggest companies and startups, Python is the most used language for Data Science and Machine Learning Projects
Stackoverflow survey for 2019 had Python outrank Java in the list of most loved languages
Python is a very versatile language since it has a wide array of functionalities already available. The sheer range of functionalities might sound too exhaustive and complicated, you don’t need to be well-versed with them all.
Most data scientists have a few go-to libraries for their daily tasks like:

Most industry experts recommend starting your Data Science journey with Python
Across biggest companies and startups, Python is the most used language for Data Science and Machine Learning Projects
Stackoverflow survey for 2019 had Python outrank Java in the list of most loved languages
Python is a very versatile language since it has a wide array of functionalities already available. The sheer range of functionalities might sound too exhaustive and complicated, you don’t need to be well-versed with them all.
Most data scientists have a few go-to libraries for their daily tasks like:

Twitter Sentiment Analysis,"What is Sentiment Analysis?
Sentiment Analysis or Opinion Mining is a technique used to analyse the emotion in a text. We can extract the attitude or the opinion of a piece of text and get insights on it. 
In the context of machine learning, you can think of Sentiment Analysis as a Classification problem where the text can either have a positive sentiment, a negative sentiment or a neutral one.

What are the applications of Sentiment Analysis in the industry?
In the age of social media, it is extremely common to comment about 
a movie you liked or 
a book you didn’t like or 
a product you bought was not up to the mark.
Therefore, a lot of companies use sentiment analysis for their products since it provides direct feedback of the customer’s opinion.
It is also important to detect and remove hateful content from social media and companies like Twitter, Facebook, etc. extensively use sentiment analysis on a daily basis.
  On what kind of projects would I implement sentiment analysis?
There are a wide variety of projects where you can use Sentiment Analysis. Here are a couple of popular use cases:
Sentiment Analysis can not only be used for customer reviews or product feedback, but in other domains as well.
Analyzing the sentiments on social media on the US Elections, for example, gives useful insights on which candidates are favoured by the public and which are not.
For other interesting problems involving sentiment/emotion detection, you can visit: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/all/

What is the range of sentiments that can be observed and analysed?
In the earlier days of Natural language processing and Sentiment Analysis, the sentiments could hold only 2 or 3 values: Positive or Negative, and Positive, Neutral or Negative.
However, with the advent of deep learning, we can now recognize the subtle emotions in a text as well.
This has made tasks like Sarcasm detection, fake news detection etc. popular in research areas of Natural language processing 

Can I add this project to my resume and use it in my Interview?
Sentiment Analysis is one of the most popular applications of Machine Learning and Classification in Natural language processing
We also encourage you to take up more diverse datasets and apply sentiment analysis on them.

Hypothesis Testing for Data Science and Analytics,"Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organisation of data. For all the data science and machine learning enthusiasts it is paramount to be well versed with various statistical concepts such as Hypothesis testing
Every day we find ourselves testing new ideas, finding the fastest route to the office, the quickest way to finish our work, or simply finding a better way to do something we love. The critical question, then, is whether our idea is significantly better than what we tried previously.
These ideas that we come up with on such a regular basis – that’s essentially what a hypothesis is. And testing these ideas to figure out which one works and which one is best left behind, is called hypothesis testing.
